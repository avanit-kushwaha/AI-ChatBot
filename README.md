The Healthcare Assistant Chatbot is an interactive tool designed to assist users with healthcare-related queries in a conversational manner. Built using Streamlit and Hugging Face's Transformers library, the chatbot provides answers to common health concerns like symptoms, medications, and appointment scheduling. For queries outside of healthcare, the chatbot generates creative, natural responses using a pre-trained GPT-2 model. The chatbot also features a conversation history, so users can view previous interactions and track their queries over time. To use the chatbot, simply input your query, and the bot will either provide specific healthcare advice or generate a response based on the context of your question. The project is easy to set up, and once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can start chatting by running the app with a single command. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to anyone seeking healthcare information in an interactive and engaging format. Feel free to explore and modify the project to add new features or customize the responses for more personalized interactions.
